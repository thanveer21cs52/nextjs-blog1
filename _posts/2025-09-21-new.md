If you use this endpoint and the "[Delete a file](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents/#delete-a-file)" endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.

OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint. The `workflow` scope is also required in order to modify files in the `.github/workflows` directory.

### [**Fine-grained access tokens for "Create or update file contents"**](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-or-update-file-contents--fine-grained-access-tokens)

This endpoint works with the following fine-grained token types:

*   [GitHub App user access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app)
    
*   [GitHub App installation access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-an-installation-access-token-for-a-github-app)
    
*   [Fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)
    

The fine-grained token must have at least one of the following permission sets:

*   "Contents" repository permissions (write)
    
*   "Contents" repository permissions (write) and "Workflows" repository permissions (write)
